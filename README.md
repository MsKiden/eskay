I am a technologist and researcher, interested in how technology and society intersect. I have researched and worked on projects that build, deploy, train and advocate for technology solutions and meaningful Internet access for grassroots communities. I was a 2017-2018 Ford-Mozilla Open Web Fellow, hosted by Research ICT Africa and working on Internet measurements. Through the OpenDoTT project, I hope to explore possibilities for smaller-scale local IoT technology and how communities can be supported in making the best use of them. I hold an MSc in Information Systems and BSc in Information Technology.
